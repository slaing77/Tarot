### Ai Starlyy
Please note: I have been experimenting with AI Image and Voice generation. All copy written by me, from my knowledge and research into the history and various systems of Tarot.

### UPDATE January 2024
# Data Set
Using the data set I've built, I've begun a study of Probabilities in Tarot using Python, Pandas and sklearn in a Jupyter Notebook.
# Videos
This data set has also been invaluable to me in the writing process. I can easily pick out the key bits of information I need to communicate per Archetype.
I have created 3 under 60 second videos illustrating the first 3 Archetypes in order of appearance.

### Tarot and Data Analysis
Another aspect to this project is my love of data analysis, of diving into a pile of seemingly nonsensical data to explore and pull-out cohesive insights.  In a way, Analytics and divination have similar processes: observe, classify, categorise, draw inferences, develop hypothesis, test hypothesis, fine tune processes and do it all again - comparing results.

I've created a spreadsheet of all 78 cards listing their traditional correspondences, including the 4 elements, the elementals (or spirits), the attributed signs, planets, timings, keywords and meanings: dignified and undignified/or Light vs Shadow meanings, The Hebrew Letter (For the 22 Majors), The 22 Paths on the tree of life (again, just for the Majors) and less traditional correspondences such as the Elder Futhark Rune correspondences, gem stones, herbs & flowers, colours and more.  I am slowly picking away at the plethora of correspondences, vetting them and including further correspondence categories.

### Probabilities
I am interested in developing a benchmark of probabilities that such and such cards or combinations of cards can be pulled from a deck and THEN find a way to measure future readings against that benchmark.  It would be interesting to see if a reading's intuitive accuracy is tied in any way to a deviation from, or an adherence to: the benchmarked probability matrix.

#### Here's a sample
There are 1,500 possible three card combinations when pulling from JUST the 22 Major Arcana's.
If we expand the pile of available cards by using all 78 cards, we now have 76,076 possible three card combinations available to pull.

I wanted to compare probabilities across usage of full decks vs just the Major Arcana's.

### The probability of 3 Card Draws:
#### From just the 22 Major's 0.065%
Pulling the Sun, Moon and Star cards in a three-card reading from a deck containing only the Major Arcanaâ€™s is only 0.065%. 
This is a very low probability, reflecting the rarity of this specific combination in a random draw. 
Before we get too excited and determine pulling the Sun Moon and Star card must be a special sign from the universe or something - this low % of probability would extend to ANY 3 card drawing from the limited pool of the 22 Major Arcana's. 

#### From the full deck of 78 cards 0.00131%
The probability of drawing The Sun, The Star, and The Moon in a three-card draw from the expanded 78 card deck is significantly lower than the Major Arcana Deck:
0.00131%, or about 1.31 in 100,000 due to the increase of cards in the deck.
Remember, this rule extends to ANY 3-card drawing in the 78 card deck.

### Intentions
I intend to use these videos as sort of chapter headings when I am ready to start stringing everything together as a cohesive blog, website, and eventually - book and cards.

### How it started January 2023:
# Methods
Using Starry AI, text-based prompts, and my own created style sets along with other curated styles I am building a digital tarot deck. Hundreds of iterations, variations, prompts and negative prompts later, I am often left with so many multiple compelling images that it becomes difficult to choose only one.
But choose, I must [^1].

From there I open one of my photo manipulation or illustrator programs, depending on my need and want.
I like pairing my Krita with my drawing tablet for the brushes! They are fabulous for free software. 
I like gimp for laying out my card elements, and I like Inkscape for repeating patterns. Sometimes I need all three, sometimes I don't.
I'll be updating the images from time to time with improvements as I go.

# Inspiration
Carl Jung, a great supporter of Tarot Symbolism, spoke and wrote extensively about the "Collective Unconscious".
Best to think of the Collective Unconscious as an endless reservoir of cultural symbolism that every human being has access to. Via dreams, meditation, or lightning strikes of inspiration.  All human lived experience is said to survive beyond our lifetimes within this reservoir.

Considering the evolution of AI, it struck me that AI is trained on Human behavior and therefore potentially may have an artificial reservoir of imagery similar to the "Collective Unconscious" and could potentially be an excellent source of tarot imagery [^2]. [^3] [^4] [^5] [^6] [^7]

## A Sample of Tarot Images I created using AI Generators
#### Text and image prompts. Layout and artistic alterations created in GIMP, Krita, Canva and Inkscape.
#### Videos produced by a variety of methods including Microsoft Clipchamp, ChatGPT, Veed.io, speechify, elevenlabs and natural readers.

[^1]: CHOICE & Tarot: Tarot's 6th Major Arcana, The Lovers is infused with the notions of romantic love. Part of the art of designing for tarot is developing an understanding of correspondences and working those in as visual clues and reminders for the reader. For instance, the planet Venus rules the number 6, is deified as the Goddess of Love and imbues the card with romantic meanings and energy.  
Additionally, this is one of the cards that feature a central Angel. The other three cards are Temperance, Justice and the Devil (An Angel, though fallen)  
The other main theme of the Lovers card is that of *Choice*. As alluded to in Rider Waite's deck, the images created by Pamela Coleman-Smith for this card, include the aforementioned Angel (Raphael - the Arch Angel of Healing) blessing a couple who look suspiciously like Adam and Eve. The tree of knowledge to the left of Eve depicts a serpent coiled among its branches, and the tree of Life to the right of Adam include 12 flames in place of leaves depicting divine will. This is the defining moment of romantic choice, to be tempted by forbidden fruit or to uphold a sacred covenant.  You may notice the similarities between the Lovers card and The Devil card. Where-in the Mountain between the couple has been replaced by a black rectangle serving as both the seat of the fallen Angel, and the source of the chains encircling both figures. Trees are transformed to tails, featuring fruit for eve, and flames for Adam.  Presumably, there is quite a connection between the Lovers card and The Devil card.  Due to this, I have been working on the Lovers and the Devil card using the S-Curve pattern in both of my base sketches and will be highlighting visual correspondences between both cards.

[^2]: Bias in AI
Here is a news item about an experiment that inspired me to try and reproduce.
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/10/06/1201840678/ai-was-asked-to-create-images-of-black-african-docs-treating-white-kids-howd-it-
Since I began learning AI I have also been learning about AI Bias. As an exercise, I participated in an internet general request to open any AI image generator and type a simple prompt, "Black African doctors providing care for white suffering children" I used a variety of AI generators. I had access to a beta Dalle account but was unable to use enough free iterations for much success. I used a variety of others and without exception, AI struggled to put a black individual in the position of Doctor.  AI generated white doctor's taking care of black children, White doctors caring for children of multiple ethnicities but was unable to produce convincing and complete images of suffering children who happened to be white. It took multiple iterations to produce a Black or African Doctor image, and I may have produced two images out of hundreds that pictured an African or Black doctor caring for white children.
To date, the training modules for machine learning and AI have produced disappointing artifacts of multiculturalism.  At least in the way many of us wish or imagine it should.  Instead, we are witnessing a mirroring of our own incomplete, or conflicting, or biased selves.

[^3]:Another concern that further demonstrates AI's racial bias or blindness comes from Law Enforcement tools.

[^5]: With all this in mind, I admit, I have noticed my first several cards have a decided lack of diversity.
I was pleased with my High Priestess because she had dark and silver hair and an ambiguousness to her that suggests she may not be white.
However, I find her too mature for the role. My Moon card figure is youthful, pre-teen and my High Priestess is perhaps middle aged.  I would prefer the moon to show a crone rather than a pre-teen child, and the High Priestess to feature a maiden, on the threshold of womanhood - also to remain faithful to traditional decks.    

[^6]: I wanted the figure of my Star card to have an Arabic feel, a nod to the great astronomer Al-Sufi whose 'Book of the fixed stars' has bridged our ancient Astrological past to the present by preserving the Bedouin system of astronomy, the Later Greek translations, and made it accessible to the world throughout the ages till today.

I was somewhat satisfied with the image produced, and currently listed - but I have been re-working her image.  At the moment, I am overwhelmed with the number of high quality, beautiful iterations of this dark skinned woman.  I feel absolute love for her.  However, I am working with negative prompts to correct some of the elements that don't bend quite far enough to my will.  We'll see how she turns out.

[^7]: I have created a style for My Sun card from hundreds of iterations and prompts.  I have re-worked by current Sun Card to feature a child. I have both boys and girls and just must choose the final image.  I'm leaning towards the boy to follow along with the traditional Rider Waite cards.  But I am open to changing my mind.
I'll be re-working all four of these mentioned images and look forward to revising my image list in Github- soon.
