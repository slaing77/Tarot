# Methods
### UPDATE January 2024
I've begun creating short video's as part of this project. 
The idea is to introduce the viewer to each archetype of the 22 Major Arcana's from the Archetypes POV.
I've constrained the content to less than 60 seconds of video each, which gives me on avergare 40 seconds of narration.
It is challenging to fit 7 centuries of traditions into 30 second sound bites.  I do enjoy a challenge and so far, I am pleased with the results.

I have created 3 under 60 second videos illustrating the first 3 Archetpes in order of appearance; 0. The Fool, 1. The Magician, 2. The High Priestess.

### I am taking a break on video creation today, to focus on fleshing out a bit of the underlying structure of the tarot which will by necessity include:
1. A brief (I hope) rundown on the history of Tarot.
2. Intro to Correspondants, what they are and how to use them.
3. The 4 Elemental dignitaries and how they interplay between cards. 
4. An intro to the 22 Hebrew Letter names for each Major Arcana
5. An intro to the 10 Sefirot
6. An intro to the 3 Triads of Sefirot with an exploration of the first triad as represented by the first three cards, 0. The Fool, 1. The Magician and 2. The High Preistess.


###Intentions
I intend to use these video's as sort of chapter headings when I am ready to start stringing everything together as a cohesive blog, website, and eventually - book and cards.

### How it started January 2023:
Using Starry AI, text based prompts, and my own created style sets along with other curated styles I am building a tarot deck. Hundreds of iterations, variations, prompts and negative prompts later, I am often left with so many multiple compelling images that it becomes difficult to choose only one.
But choose, I must [^1].

From there I open one of my photo manipulation or illustrator programs, depending on my need and want.
I like pairing my Krita with my drawing tablet for the brushes! They are fabulous for free software. 
I like gimp for laying out my card elements, and I like Inkscape for repeating patterns. Sometimes I need all three, sometimes I don't.
I'll be updating the images from time to time with improvements as I go.

# Inspiration
Carl Jung, a great supporter of Tarot Symbolism, spoke and wrote extensively about the "Collective Unconscious".
Best to think of the Collective Unconscious as an endless reservoir of cultural symbolism that every human being has access to. Via dreams, meditation, or lightning strikes of inspiration.  All human lived experience is said to survive beyond our lifetimes within this reservoir.

Considering the evolution of AI, it struck me that AI is trained on Human behavior and therefore potentially may have an artificial reservoir of imagery similar to the "Collective Unconscious" and could potentially be an excellent source of tarot imagery [^2]. [^3] [^4] [^5] [^6] [^7]

[^1]: CHOICE & Tarot: Tarot's 6th Major Arcana, The Lovers is infused with the notions of romantic love. Part of the art of designing for tarot is developing an understanding of correspondences and working those in as visual clues and reminders for the reader. For instance, the planet Venus rules the number 6, is deified as the Goddess of Love and imbues the card with romantic meanings and energy.  
Additionally, this is one of the cards that feature a central Angel. The other three cards are Temperance, Justice and the Devil (An Angel, though fallen)  
The other main theme of the Lovers card is that of *Choice*. As eluded to in Rider Waite's deck, the images created by Pamela Coleman-Smith for this card, include the aforementioned Angel (Raphael - the Arch Angel of Healing) blessing a couple who look suspiciously like Adam and Eve. The tree of knowledge to the left of Eve depicts a serpent coiled among its branches, and the tree of Life to the right of Adam include 12 flames in place of leaves depicting divine will. This is the defining moment of romantic choice, to be tempted by forbidden fruit or to uphold a sacred covenant.  You may notice the similarities between the Lovers card and The Devil card. Where-in the Mountain between the couple has been replaced by a black rectangle serving as both the seat of the fallen Angel, and the source of the chains encircling both figures. Trees are transformed to tails, featuring fruit for eve, and flames for Adam.  Presumably, there is quite a connection between the Lovers card and The Devil card.  Due to this, I have been working on the Lovers and the Devil card using the S-Curve pattern in both of my base sketches and will be highlighting visual correspondences between both cards.

[^2]: Bias in AI
Here is a news item about an experiment that inspired me to try and reproduce.
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/10/06/1201840678/ai-was-asked-to-create-images-of-black-african-docs-treating-white-kids-howd-it-
Since I began learning AI I have also been learning about AI Bias. As an exercise, I participated in an internet general request to open any AI image generator and type a simple prompt, "Black African doctors providing care for white suffering children" I used a variety of AI generators. I had access to a beta Dalle account but was unable to use enough free iterations for much success. I used a variety of others and without exception, AI struggled to put a black individual in the position of Doctor.  AI generated white doctor's taking care of black children, White doctors caring for children of multiple ethnicities but was unable to produce convincing and complete images of suffering children who happened to be white. It took multiple iterations to produce a Black or African Doctor image, and I may have produced two images out of hundreds that pictured an African or Black doctor caring for white children.
To date, the training modules for machine learning and AI have produced disappointing artifacts of multiculturalism.  At least in the way many of us wish or imagine it should.  Instead, we are witnessing a mirroring of our own incomplete, or conflicting, or biased selves.

[^3]:Another concern that further demonstrates AI's racial bias or blindness comes from Law Enforcement tools.

[^5]:With all this in mind, I admit, I have noticed my first several cards have a decided lack of diversity.
I was pleased with my High Priestess because she had dark and silver hair and an ambiguousness to her that suggests she may not be white.
However, I find her too mature for the role. My Moon card figure is youthful, pre-teen and my High Priestess is perhaps middle aged.  I would prefer the moon to show a crone rather than a pre-teen child, and the High Preistess to feature a a maiden, on the threshhold of womanhood - also to remain faithful to traditional decks.    

[^6]:I wanted the figure of my Star card to have an Arabic cast to her, a nod to the great astronomer Al-Sufi whose 'Book of the fixed stars' has bridged our ancient Astrological past to the present by preserving the Bedouin system of astronomy, the Later Greek translations, and made it accessible to the world throughout the ages till today.

I was somewhat satisfied with the image produced, and currently listed - but I have been working on giving her a darker skin tone.  At the moment, I am overwhelmed with the number of high quality, beautiful iterations of this dark skinned woman.  I feel absolute love for her.  However I am working with negative prompts to correct some of the elements that don't bend quite far enough to my will.  We'll see how she turns out.

[^7]:I have created a style for My Sun card from hundreds of iterations and prompts.  I have re-worked by current Sun Card to feature a child. I have both boys and girls and just have to choose the final image.  I'm leaning towards the boy in order to follow along with the traditional Rider Waite cards.  But I am open to changing my mind.
I'll be re-working all four of these mentioned images and look forward to revising my image list in Github- soon.
