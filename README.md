Tarot Cards II
Using a variety of AI engines, original sketches, and text based prompts I am building a tarot deck.
Carl Jung, a great supporter of Tarot Symbolism spoke and wrote extensively about the "Collective Unconcious".
Best to think of the Collective Unconscious as an endless resevior of cultural symbolism that every human being has access to. Via dreams, meditation, or lightening strikes of inspiration.  All human lived experience is said to survive beyond our lifetimes within this resevoir.

Considering the evolution of AI, it struck me that AI is trained on Human behaviour and therefore potentially may have an artificial resevior of imagery similar to the "Collective Unconsious" and could potentially be an excellent source of tarot imagery.

Here is my AI (Artistic Intellegent) Tarot - in progress.
